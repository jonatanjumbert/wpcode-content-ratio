This plugin extracts the text of all your pages and posts from HTML code and calculates the content ratio based on this information.

== Description ==

The Code to Text Ratio represents the percentage of actual text in a web page. This plugin extracts the text of all your pages and posts from HTML code and calculates the content ratio based on this information.

= Why is it important? =

The code to text ratio of a page is used by search engines and spiders to calculate the relevancy of a web page. A higher code to text ratio gives you a better chance of getting a good page ranking for your page.

Not all search engines are using the code to text ratio in their index algorithm, but most of them do. So having a higher code to text ratio than your competitors gives you a good start for on-site optimization.

= % Ratios and meanings: =

* 0% - 10%: Consider adding more content or revamping your code.
* 10% - 25%: Content is moderate, but always room to improve.
* 25% - 70%: Generally good, but don't over do it.
* 70% - 100%: If you've got higher than about 70% or so then you've got a lot of text and not a lot of code, which might sound like a good thing, but could represent spam too.

= Ways to lower the amount of code on a web page =

* Use CSS layouts instead of table-based layouts.
* Put CSS and Javascript into external files.
* Take out tags that have no purpose.
* Use valid code. After all, a page scoring 25% which works everywhere is usually better than one which scores 50% but fails in most browsers.
* Write more text on your posts.
